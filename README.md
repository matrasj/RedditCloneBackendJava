# RedditCloneBackend
Main goal of project RedditColone was to create application as much as possible similar to real Reddit. In backend side I used Spring Boot with help of Hibernate as ORM and MySQL as database. In app as a user you can post, comment, like and etc ( bigger description of functionalities you can find in frontend repo under this link: )
To authenticated users I used JWT.
